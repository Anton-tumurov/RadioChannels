# RadioChannels
This [sampling accepted] python script is designed for jumping UHF CB channels with your 'team' so no-one can listen in to your conversations!
<h2>Online functionality</h2>
<p>This project uses <a href='jsonbins.io'>jsonbins.io</a> to store User Login Information and the current channel for each TEAM.</p>
<p>Here is a preview:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "teams": {
    "Team A": {
      "current_channel": 54
    },
    "Team B": {
      "current_channel": 52
    },
    "Team C": {
      "current_channel": 68
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

If you would like to use this program, consider contacting me (github issues) to either create a User(as a demo), or for me to give you a private copy.
